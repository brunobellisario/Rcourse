# Rcourse
Data Analysis with R.

With the raise of biological, bioinformatic and ecological tools & data, knowing some degree of programming languages is essential for any researcher in life sciences.

R, a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, is heavily used in biological and ecological sciences, and therefore, a must have in any researcher portfolio.

The course consists in different short modules (named "sessions") focusing on a topic related with R.
Each session has the objective of introducing a given topic and will be very practical with minimal focus on theory. 

In this repository, you can find the slides, R scripts & data for the course. 

Below, a simple and NOT exhaustive list of the main topics covered by the course.
